/*
maybe each game can be its own page?
OR a page of class game page (if I can extend twice...) so it has a frame...
nah just make each game a page


before a game starts I should have a lil test
test optical flow direction (like the lil practical game - ask to move right and throw correct if they do)
check correct number of faces
test where face is

also before game starts/in instruction section have like
"for best results, place your computer/webcam on a flat, stable surface and ..
  - position yourself with your head entirely in the frame
  - your upper body within the frame
  - both player's heads etc. "
  
  
should do something if no camera is detected

Instructions
To choose a game, move left and right through the game menu by pressing the arrow buttons, the arrow keys on your keyboard.
You can also move left and right by moving your head or body left or right within view of the camera! This can be a bit fiddly to get right, so feel free to use the traditional controls
Motion controls can be turned off in settings if they're getting in your way.


With a leaderboard - can I actually maintain scores between sessions? I guess if I write them to a file...
Also maybe no leaderboard, maybe just track high scores
